This project involved analyzing a real-world restaurant dataset to identify meaningful patterns and insights. The dataset included features such as restaurant names, ratings, location coordinates (latitude and longitude), and other key attributes. The focus of the project was to clean the data, explore relationships between variables, and generate visual insights using Python.

Key Tasks Performed:
Cleaned and prepared the dataset by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand rating distribution and restaurant trends.
Analyzed relationships between location coordinates (lat/long) and restaurant ratings.
Created visualizations to identify location-based clusters and performance patterns.
Interpreted insights that could help in understanding high-performing areas and rating behavior.

Tools & Technologies:
Python
Pandas, NumPy
Matplotlib (and/or Seaborn)
Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab
